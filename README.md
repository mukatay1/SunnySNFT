**Project Name SUNSNFT**

**Description:**

This README is part of a project that deploys an Ethereum smart contract named "SUNSNFT" using the Hardhat development environment. The smart contract includes features like ERC-721, ERC-721Enumerable, ERC-721URIStorage, ERC-721Pausable, and is owned by an address specified during deployment. The script deploys the contract, waits for deployment to complete, and logs the contract's address. It's a starting point for creating your own NFT  project on the Ethereum blockchain.

**Usage:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Modify the deployment parameters in the JavaScript script.
4. Run the deployment script using `npx hardhat run script.js`.
5. The contract address will be logged to the console upon successful deployment.
